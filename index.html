        <h1>Moon Computing and Data Centre</h1><hr/>
        <h2>Abstract</h2><br/>
        <h3>Issue:</h3>
        <p>The amount of computational power required to power up our everyday life is directly proportional 
            to time. In other words, we need more computational power as the time goes on. This is because we 
            are currently building our life based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computing 
            machinery</a> in order to make things easy. Computational power is "generated" by computing machinery.
            Setting up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center">an array of digital computing machines
            </a> would take up a lot of space. Furthermore, an additional energy-consuming cooling system would be 
            needed for most of the places on earth. We may not take 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</a> into account since Antarctica shall 
            remain untouched. The same concept for Antarctica may be applied to countries such as 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norway</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland">Finland</a>, and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden">Sverige</a>. This suggests that the 
            "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum">lebensraum</a>" for digital computing machines on 
            earth is running out. We may now consider looking for a new planet to install our digital computing 
            machinery (<strike>and freedom</strike>).</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/00.gif" alt=""></img>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>The solution to the problem described above can be solved by moving our machines onto 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">the moon</a>, preferably, in the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_craters">lunar craters</a>. The reason 
            for choosing the moon as the location for the installation is that the moon is the nearest planet to 
            earth and we have landed on it. We shall be placing our computing machines in the moon craters because 
            moon craters are generally cold. Thus, an additional air conditioner for cooling the system would not 
            be needed. The design and abstraction of the solution can be found in the section below. </p>
        <h3>Design Abstraction:</h3>
        <p>The Moon Data and Computing centre is a data and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">
           cloud computing</a> centre built in the crater of the moon. 
           The computing centre is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design">modular</a> infrastructure 
           consisted of five different types of modules. Among these are, one energy generation module, five energy 
           storage modules, four thermal modules, a data transmission module, and one computing module.</p>
        <br/><h2>The Modules:</h2><br/>
        <h3>Energy Generation Module:</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the energy generation module shall be self-explanatory, that is, a module that generates 
            energy for the facility. The type of energy generation the module is designed to use is 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion">nuclear fusion</a>. 
            Nuclear fusion is chosen because it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy">renewable</a> 
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability">sustainable</a> because nuclear fusion does not 
            take up a lot of space, has a virtually inexhaustible supply (e.g. hydrogen), doesn't have carbon emission, 
            and doesn't leave any long-lived <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste">radioactive waste</a> 
            like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission">nuclear fission</a>.</p>
        <p>In a nuclear fusion reaction, energy is released when two nuclei join together and this is basically how 
            the sun work. This reaction is very hard to make without a strong gravitational force or an extremely 
            high temperature, however, I will assume that we have the capability to make this reaction occur in this 
            project.</p>
        <p>The nuclear fusion reactor of this project will be using two isotopes of hydrogen as its fuel since it can 
            be obtained from water through the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water">
            electrolysation</a>. Two of the isotopes of hydrogen are 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium">deuterium</a> (H^2,  it has one 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron">neutron</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium">
            tritium</a> (H^3, it has two neutrons). These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus">nuclei</a> 
            are charged when they are far apart so they are constantly repelling each other. However, these nuclei will stop 
            repelling and start pulling each other together once they get close enough (the force pulling them together is 
            called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction">
            strong force</a>). Later on, two of the hydrogen isotopes will be fused together and yield 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4">helium-4</a>, one lonely neutron, 
            and some of the mass are converted into energy according to the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass–energy_equivalence">mass-energy equivalence</a> (E=∆m(c^2)). Below is the 
            visualisation of the process of a D-T reaction:</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/01.gif" alt=""></img>
        <p>The amount of energy released from one D-T reaction can be can be calculated using the mass-energy equivalence 
            equation where E is in Joule, ∆m is the change in mass in kg, and c is the speed of light and that is a 
            constant (299,792,458 m*s^-1):</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/02.png" alt=""></img>
        <p>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit">atomic mass unit</a> of deuterium, tritium, helium-4 
            and a neutron are 2.01410178u, 3.0160492u, 4.00262u, and 1.008644u respectively. So the change in mass can be 
            calculated by subtracting the initial mass with the final mass since some of the mass are converted into energy:</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/03.png" alt=""></img>
        <img src="./lib/img/05.png" alt=""></img>
        <p>Note that the change in mass we got above is in the atomic mass unit (AMU). But the mass in the mass-energy 
            equivalence equation is defined as kg. Therefore, we will have to multiply the change in mass in AMU with 
            1.66054E-27 in order to convert that into kg:</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/06.png" alt=""></img>
        <p>Once we have all the information that we need, we may now substitute the appropriate numbers into the 
            mass-energy equivalence equation:</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/04.png" alt=""></img>
        <p>2.81843016E-12 Joule may seem like a small amount of energy, however, this is just the energy released by
            the fusion of two atoms. Therefore, if we apply, for example, 100 kg of each hydrogen of isotopes as the fuel 
            for the nuclear fusion reactor; then we will be able to create a tremendous amount of energy. But for now, in 
            order to make things simple and processable, we may just assume that this nuclear reactor will continuously 
            provide enough kinetic energy to boil the water inside the boiler which we will be getting into in the next 
            section.</p>
        <p>In order to capture the energy generated by the fusion reaction, we may consider using the method of a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_cycle">thermodynamic cycle</a>. This should be a good 
            option because a thermodynamic cycle is pretty straightforward. You basically heat up some fluid using the heat 
            released from the fusion reaction to turn a turbine that is attached to a generator. And this situation can be 
            modelled by the diagram shown below:</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/07.png" width="75%" height="75%"  alt=""></img>
        <p>Note that converting heat into work entirely is not possible in a cyclic system according to the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics">Second Law of Thermodynamics</a>. We can still 
        assume that our generator has the efficiency of 99% just to make things simple. Anyway, here you go the schematic 
        of our nuclear fusion power generator:</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/08.png" alt=""></img>
        <p>Here you might be wondering how much energy the process of vapourisation for the fluid (H2O) in the boiler would 
            require. Since the temperature in a moon crater is very cold, the water will freeze. However, since the steam 
            tubes inside a boiler will be melting the water. Thus, we can assume that the temperature of the water is one 
            degree above its melting point to make things simple. Furthermore, we want to turn the turbine with the 
            superheated steam (high pressure), that is, heating the water to its 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(thermodynamics)">critical point</a>. The critical point for 
            water is around 647.15 Kelvin. This problemo can be solved by applying the following two equations:</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/09.png" alt=""></img><br/>
        <img src="./lib/img/10.png" alt=""></img>
        <p>First of all , let us say that our boiler contains 48,400 litres of water and that is about 48,400 kg. We can 
            then use the specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity">heat capacity</a> of water to find 
            the energy of require to heat up water from one degree celsius to its boiling point (100 degrees celsius):</p>
         <img src="./lib/img/11.png" alt=""></img><br/>   
         <img src="./lib/img/12.png" alt=""></img><br/>
         <img src="./lib/img/13.png" alt=""></img>
         <p>Once the water gets into the process of vapourisation, the amount of energy required for this process to complete 
             can be calculated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat">latent heat</a> of vapourisation 
             of water:</p>
         <img src="./lib/img/14.png" alt=""></img><br/>
         <img src="./lib/img/15.png" alt=""></img><br/>
         <img src="./lib/img/18.png" alt=""></img>
         <p>The amount of kinetic energy needed heating up the water inside the boiler to its critical point (374 degrees 
            celsius) can be found by using the specific heat capacity of water vapour:</p>
         <img src="./lib/img/16.png" alt=""></img><br/>
         <img src="./lib/img/19.png" alt=""></img><br/>
         <img src="./lib/img/20.png" alt=""></img>
        <p>Finally, by finding the sum of the change in energy in each segment, we will be able to get the amount of energy 
            required to heat up the water inside the boiler to the critical point:</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/21.png" alt=""></img><br/>
        <img src="./lib/img/17.png" alt=""></img>
        <p></p><br/><h3>Energy Storage Module:</h3>
        <p>An energy storage module is a module that stores electricity and is designed to power up 20,000 500W digital computers 
            for 24 hours in case of emergency. Furthermore, each energy storage module is consisted of 2667 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S">Tesla Model S</a> battery packs, each battery pack has the 
            capacity for about 90 kWh. Theoretically, the capacity of each energy storage module is about 235 mWh with the
            efficiency of 99%.</p>
        <p>The schematic of the connections between the power generation module, energy storage modules, and the computation module 
            may look something like this:</p>
        <img src="./lib/img/22.png" alt=""></img>
        <p></p><br/><h3>Computing Module:</h3>
        <p>The computing module is a module that is made up of 100,000 digital computing machines, and each digital computing 
            machine in the module runs at 500 kWh. Therefore, about five energy storage modules are needed in case of emergency. 
            The specification of the entire computing module is not shown here because it can be vary depending on the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation#Information_technology_.28IT.29">implementation</a>.</p>
        <p></p><br/><h3>Thermal Module:</h3>
        <P>The purpose of a thermal module in this computing centre is to cool down the entire system. Furthermore, since this 
            computing centre will be built in a place that is very close to a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum">vacuum</a>, methods to dispense heat such as 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection">convection</a> and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction">conduction</a> would not work. Therefore, we could use 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation#Thermal_radiation_.28heat.29">radiation</a> to dispense the heat 
            out of the system. One thermal module is made up of many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiator">radiators</a> 
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia">ammonia</a> fluid will be pumped into the pipes of the radiators. 
            Ammonia is chosen as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolant">coolant</a> instead of regular water because 
            the melting point of ammonia is lower. In other words, the coolant would not freeze if it is too cool outside. 
            This computing centre is surrounded by four thermal modules.The image below is an example of a radiator in space, 
            the white panel in the centre part of the image is the radiator:</P>

        <p></p><br/><h3>Data Transmission Module and Black Box Abstraction:</h3>
        <p>Every large system is made of smaller parts and each smaller part can be divided into even smaller parts. Humans 
            are able to create and manage complex systems because there are techniques for controlling the complexity the system. 
            One of the techniques which the computer scientists like to use to suppress details is the technique of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">black box abstraction</a> (e.g. defining symbols and "
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine">subroutines</a>"). Black box abstraction is just a simple concept of 
            taking some input, producing an output, without knowing the implementation of the "black box." I will apply this 
            technique to the data transmission module in order to make this project accessible and processable for the mind of a 
            single individual.</p>
